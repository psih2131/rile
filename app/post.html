                        <div class="post-sec__post-editor">
                            <p>A few weeks ago, I was on a call with a NetSuite admin who sounded exhausted.</p>

                            <p>They had launched CPQ six months earlier, worked with a solid implementation partner, and
                                at first, everything looked promising. But now?</p>

                            <p><strong>“Sales doesn’t use it. Rules don’t fire correctly. And our partner stopped
                                    responding.”</strong></p>

                            <p>Their team wasn’t just frustrated. They were losing trust in the whole system. The
                                project had quietly fallen apart.</p>

                            <p>If that sounds familiar, you’re not alone. We see this all the time. CPQ projects that
                                technically went live, but never really took off. Maybe your implementation partner
                                moved on. Maybe internal support dried up. Or maybe it just got too messy, too fast.
                                Often, the real issue isn’t the tool. It’s the scoping. Most CPQ projects fall apart
                                because someone underestimated the complexity or overpromised the timeline. We see this
                                constantly, and we fix it.</p>

                            <p>Whatever the reason, you’re left with a half-working setup, a frustrated team, and a
                                sinking feeling that you might need to rebuild everything from scratch.</p>

                            <h4>You don’t.</h4>

                            <p>That’s the myth we hear most often:</p>

                            <p><strong>“If it’s stuck, it must be broken.”</strong></p>

                            <p>In reality, you probably don’t need to start over. You just need someone who knows what
                                to do and can do it quickly.</p>

                            <h2>Enter: CPQ Triage</h2>

                            <p>When teams come to us mid-implementation or after go-live but struggling, we jump into
                                triage mode. Not a month-long discovery. Not a 60-slide proposal. Just clear, focused
                                work to stabilize what’s already in place and get things moving again.</p>

                            <p>We’ve built and rebuilt more CPQ systems than we can count.
                                In fact, we developed the original engine that became NetSuite CPQ before it was
                                acquired by Oracle. No one knows this platform better.</p>

                            <p>Here’s what triage looks like in practice:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Diagnosing rule conflicts that are jamming the system</li>
                                <li>Fixing logic so quotes flow naturally again</li>
                                <li>Cleaning up UI issues Sales can’t work around</li>
                                <li>Helping your team understand what’s fixable right now</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Part of our triage involves diving into the system in real time to identify exactly where
                                the bottlenecks are. That's where the real issues surface.</p>

                            <h4>“We didn’t need a new tool. We just needed RILE to fix it.”</h4>

                            <p>One client said that to us recently, and it stuck.</p>

                            <p>Their CPQ project had stalled out. Sales avoided the system. Leadership was ready to pull
                                the plug.</p>

                            <p>We'll quickly get you functional again. That's what triage is for: quick stabilization so
                                you can decide how far you want us to take it. From working system to polished final
                                solution, that's your call.</p>

                            <p>If your CPQ feels like it’s circling the drain, pause before you rebuild. You might be
                                days away from getting back on track.</p>

                            <p>And if you're not sure what’s fixable, we offer a complimentary 45-minute consult. No
                                pressure. Just answers.</p>
